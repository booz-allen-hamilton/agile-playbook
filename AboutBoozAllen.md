## About Booz Allen's Systems Delivery
Booz Allen provides a full-stack, enterprise systems delivery capability and provides high-performing, cross-functional agile teams. We engage and lead across the full lifecyle: from user research and human-centered design, through technical implementation and help-desk support. We employ over 3500 software development staff across a variety of disciplines.

We approach agility with responsibility. Booz Allen maintains a current Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for Development (CMMI-DEV) Maturity Level 3 appraisal rating for its IT Team Development Organization. Initially achieved in September
2005 through an appraisal led by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) (now known as the CMMI Institute), this rating was most recently refreshed in October 2014 by an external appraiser. The firm has completed 16 consecutive successful CMM/CMMI appraisals.

Our Agile Community of Practice (CoP) has been in place for over 10 years. With more than 1,300 members, it serves as a clearinghouse to share and discover new practices and to stay abreast of emerging trends in the domain. In 2016, the Agile CoP hosted its first _Agile Day at Booz Allen_ internal conference, attended by over 130 Booz Allen practitioners and featuring talks from a dozen of the CoP’s members. Finally, our SmartSuite environment is a set of firmwide enterprise tools, processes, and intellectual capital that can be tailored to support agile delivery in the areas of document management, team collaboration, continuous integration, requirements management, automated code reviews, testing, and defect tracking.
